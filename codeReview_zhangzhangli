Overall
1. nice modularized code organization!
2. can't access to slide/page/video from README. Work fine from class page. Maybe update README?
3. page style is clean and clear. I like it. it could be better if improves padding/margin/button styles. 
4. would be good to have the feature of editing existing blog.
5. user can login with random username and password. Does this website only allow personal(admin) login? If so, the current login is not confidential.

Backend
1. wondering the reason of using bin/www as in the start script rather than use app.js.
2. use ES6 formatting for functions such as DBController in DBController and bin/www.
3. in DBController, do not have the mongoDB url in code, use env variable instead.
4. in DBController, lots of try and finally. Should we handle the exception using catch?
5. do we need the users.js? 

Frontend
1. add more information to meta of htmls such as author names, licenses
2. add/remove classes instead of directly using styles. e.g. for error in index.html
3. use ES6 formation for functions in js. e.g. all the functions in js files.
